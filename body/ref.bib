  abstract = {The process of finding new uses outside the scope of the original medical indication for existing drugs is known as drug repositioning. Repositioning existing drugs for new indications can offer a better risk-versus-reward trade-off as compared with other drug development strategies, and can help to deliver the productivity increases the industry needs while shifting the locus of production to biotechnology companies. Representative repositioning success stories include: duloxetine, which was originally developed for depression and is now at the US FDA as a first-in-class therapy for stress urinary incontinence; dapoxetine, which was passed over as a follow-on to fluoxetine (Prozac) and is now undergoing Phase III clinical trials as a first-in-class therapy for premature ejaculation; and thalidomide, which had a tragic beginning as an over-the-counter sedative for morning sickness in Germany and England and is now being used to treat leprosy and multiple myeloma. Challenges unique to the repositioning field include: discovering and validating the repositioning idea in the face of incomplete or antiquated data and identifying the repositioning candidate; developing novel clinical trial designs for indications that have never been pursued before; identifying and overcoming patents that could impede commercialization and developing new barriers to entry strategies. Pharmaceutical companies might own most of the raw material for repositioned drugs, but the initiative and insight to screen them for novel uses usually comes from biotech companies, who possess the ideal combination of incentives to pursue new indications for existing drugs given their level of entrepreneurship, motivation (succeed or die) and institutional flexibility.},

In a similar way, numerous drugs are there that have been successfully repurposed in managing the clinical conditions. The chapter would be highlighting the various drug repurposing strategies, drugs repurposed in the past and the current status of repurposed drugs in the orphan disease therapeutics along with regulatory guidelines for drug repurposing.},

Drug repositioning, therefore, plays an important role in optimizing the pre-clinical process of developing novel drugs by saving time and cost compared to the traditional de novo drug discovery processes. Since drug repositioning relies on data for existing drugs and diseases the enormous growth of publicly available large-scale biological, biomedical, and electronic health-related data along with the high-performance computing capabilities have accelerated the development of computational drug repositioning approaches. Multidisciplinary researchers and scientists have carried out numerous attempts, with different degrees of efficiency and success, to computationally study the potential of repositioning drugs to identify alternative drug indications. This study reviews recent advancements in the field of computational drug repositioning. First, we highlight different drug repositioning strategies and provide an overview of frequently used resources. Second, we summarize computational approaches that are extensively used in drug repositioning studies. Third, we present different computing and experimental models to validate computational methods. Fourth, we address prospective opportunities, including a few target areas. Finally, we discuss challenges and limitations encountered in computational drug repositioning and conclude with an outline of further research directions.},

  abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1\textendash 4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence\textemdash the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem'8\textemdash has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10\textendash 14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

With the rapid advancement of high-throughput technologies and the explosion of various biological data and medical data, computational drug repositioning methods have been appealing and powerful techniques to systematically identify potential drug-target interactions and drug-disease interactions. In this review, we first summarize the available biomedical data and public databases related to drugs, diseases and targets. Then, we discuss existing drug repositioning approaches and group them based on their underlying computational models consisting of classical machine learning, network propagation, matrix factorization and completion, and deep learning based models. We also comprehensively analyze common standard data sets and evaluation metrics used in drug repositioning, and give a brief comparison of various prediction methods on the gold standard data sets. Finally, we conclude our review with a brief discussion on challenges in computational drug repositioning, which includes the problem of reducing the noise and incompleteness of biomedical data, the ensemble of various computation drug repositioning methods, the importance of designing reliable negative samples selection methods, new techniques dealing with the data sparseness problem, the construction of large-scale and comprehensive benchmark data sets and the analysis and explanation of the underlying mechanisms of predicted interactions.},

  abstract = {Pharmaceutical research and development (R\&D) has become increasingly challenging for various reasons, including the proliferation of plausible targets to pursue for therapeutic innovation resulting from advances in molecular biology, most of which are yet to be validated.R\&D investments tend to focus on new therapeutic targets, which are characterized by high uncertainty and difficulty, but lower expected post-launch competition and higher sales.We find that the reorienting of investments toward high-risk/high-premium targets accounts for most of the recent decline in productivity in pharmaceutical R\&D, as measured in terms of attrition rates, development times and the number of NMEs launched.Our analysis also confirms the existence of important differences in the organization of national systems of innovation and regulation in pharmaceuticals. At first glance, the organizations with their headquarters based in European countries are characterized by a higher probability of market launch for compounds entering clinical development.However, when the composition of research portfolios is taken into account, the apparent comparative advantage of European organizations vanishes. By controlling for portfolio composition of research investments, we do not find support to the claim of R\&D productivity differences between US and European organizations, as classified according to headquarter location. These findings were confirmed by defining nationality on the basis of the location of patent inventors.When we considered sales of compounds launched in the global marketplace, we found that the average market value of NMEs launched by US companies was higher than European ones.However, the focus on the comparison between Europe and the United States misses an important finding that emerges from our analysis: the most productive organizations in pharmaceutical R\&D at present are global companies with innovative activities located on both sides of the Atlantic.},

  abstract = {Recent pharmacogenomic studies that generate sequencing data coupled with pharmacological characteristics for patient-derived cancer cell lines led to large amounts of multi-omics data for precision cancer medicine. Among various obstacles hindering clinical translation, lacking effective methods for multimodal and multisource data integration is becoming a bottleneck. Here we proposed DeepDRK, a machine learning framework for deciphering drug response through kernel-based data integration. To transfer information among different drugs and cancer types, we trained deep neural networks on more than 20~000 pan-cancer cell line-anticancer drug pairs. These pairs were characterized by kernel-based similarity matrices integrating multisource and multi-omics data including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, chemical properties of compounds and known drug-target interactions. Applied to benchmark cancer cell line datasets, our model surpassed previous approaches with higher accuracy and better robustness. Then we applied our model on newly established patient-derived cancer cell lines and achieved satisfactory performance with AUC of 0.84 and AUPRC of 0.77. Moreover, DeepDRK was used to predict clinical response of cancer patients. Notably, the prediction of DeepDRK correlated well with clinical outcome of patients and revealed multiple drug repurposing candidates. In sum, DeepDRK provided a computational method to predict drug response of cancer cells from integrating pharmacogenomic datasets, offering an alternative way to prioritize repurposing drugs in precision cancer treatment.
